A pneumatic powered catapult
----------------------------

----------------------------
Why did you make this?

It was used for an example/test for our battle bots project. 
We wanted to use a Pneumatic Fliper as our weapon but, there was little to no documentation on how to use the Pneumatics we had.
We had to do a lot of testing and experimenting to figure out how Pneumatics worked.
When we figured it out we still needed to put it in practice. This is the reason for the catapult.

I constructed it after school for an example,
it took a while of adjustment,
a lot of my fingers were pinched,
but eventually it turned out alright!

What is it made out of?

I used the Vex Robotics Chassis Kits + some other Vex pieces.
Its basically just a lot of metal with slots for screws.
